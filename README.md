##Movie Recommendation System

Introduction
This project implements a movie recommendation system using various techniques, including Content-Based, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Genre-Based approaches. The system analyzes user preferences and suggests movies based on different factors such as content similarity, user behavior, and genre preferences.

Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow
Keras
Joblib
You can install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The movie recommendation system uses the Dataset for movies and ratings. Please refer to the dataset documentation for more details.

Code Structure
The project is structured as follows:

Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the recommendation system.
knnmodel.pkl: Pickle file containing the trained KNN model.
Models
1. Content-Based Recommendation
This model suggests movies based on the content similarity of movie genres. It utilizes a CountVectorizer for tokenizing and creating a matrix of movie genres.

2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Recommendation
The KNN model recommends movies by calculating cosine similarity between movies. It uses a pivot matrix with user ratings to find similar movies.

3. Genre-Based Recommendation
This model suggests movies based on the similarity of movie genres. It calculates the Euclidean distance between the genres of a selected movie and others.

[Include screenshots or examples of the recommendation results generated by your system.]

Future Work
This project can be further enhanced by:

Incorporating user feedback for more personalized recommendations.
Implementing collaborative filtering for a hybrid recommendation system.
Scaling the system to handle larger datasets.
